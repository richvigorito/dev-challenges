# 🏆 Week [X] - [Challenge Title]

## 📝 Challenge Overview
Welcome to Week [X]'s challenge! In this challenge, we'll tackle [short description of the challenge], where you'll need to solve [main objective or task]. It's designed to test your [mention skills like algorithms, data structures, networking, etc.]. Perfect for a quick team-building exercise or some friendly competition!

### 💡 The Challenge
Your task is to build a solution for [challenge problem description]. You'll be working with [language, framework, tools] and focusing on the core concept of [focus area].

---

### 🏁 Challenge Format

- **Team vs. Team**: Race against each other to finish first!
- **Time Boxed**: You have [X] minutes to solve as many parts of the challenge as possible.
- **Collaborative**: Work together to create the best solution — splitting tasks or building a complete solution from scratch.

---

### 📋 Requirements & Specifications

- **Language/Tools**: Use [languages, frameworks, or libraries allowed].
- **Core Features**: Your solution should:
  - [List core features or functionality]
  - [Example: Handle input/output as specified]
  - [Example: Solve using only recursion/bitwise operations/etc.]

- **Constraints**:
  - [List any performance or memory constraints, e.g., "no sorting algorithms"]
  - [Any specific rules like "no using built-in math functions", "must implement your own search algorithm", etc.]

### 🔧 Example Usage

```python
# Example usage in Python
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = your_solution_function(input_data)
print(result)  # Expected output: [processed data]
```
