# üìùWeek [15] - Pen and Paper

## üìö Background 
In 2013, author Michael Lewis published [Flash Boys](
https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393351599)
about the rise of high-frequency trading (HFT) and the impact of technology on financial markets. There is a lot of fascinating content in the book, one wild story including a company spending $300 million to build a fiber-optic cable between Chicago and New York to shave off 3 milliseconds in trade execution time, ensuring they could execute trades faster than competitors and gain an edge in the market, see: [Spread Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_Networks). 

## üìù Challenge Overview  
This challenge is inspired from another interesting story about the training of Russian programmers in the 80s/90s. Access to computers was limited, so students were given pen and paper to solve problems. They had to write code by hand, simulate execution, and debug without a computer. By the time they got access to computers, they were already solved the problem on paper, and at the point it was just a matter of typing it in. Today we do the same. 


## üèÅ Challenge Format  
**Solo or Head-to-Head**   
Given the following (leetcode problem)[https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description] (or can pick a different one obviously) set 20 minutes on the clock. Solving via pen an paper- no computers, no IDEs, no syntax highlighting, no auto-complete, no AI assistance, no nothing. Just you, a pen, and a piece of paper. After 15 minutes, reset the timer and type the solution into your computer or leetcode directly. First to solve wins.


## ü§î But Seriously, Why?
Google "is AI making us dumber" and you'll find a ton of articles about how AI is making us lazy, less creative, and less capable of solving problems on our own. In this weird moment where every job application is asking for "AI experience", yet we are still expected to solve problems on our own as part of the interview process, this challenge is a great way to practice solving problems without relying on AI or other tools. Everyone knows, the best way to learn anything is to do it yourself, and this challenge is no different.
