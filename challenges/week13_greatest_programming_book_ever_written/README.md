# 🏆 Week [13] - The Greatest Programming Book Ever

## 📝 Challenge Overview  
    
In 2013, while taking an Algorithms course at Portland State University the professor [Dr. Herbert Mayer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_G._Mayer), a deeply respected authority in computer science, lifted this book and in his thick German accent said *"dis est de best programming book ever vritten."*; which I thought was incredible because 1) he just brought in the book in to show it off, it wasnt course material and 2) considering the [books that he wrote himself](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Herbert-G.-Mayer/author/B001KIAOAM) figured it must of been good. I bought the book immediately, saw it was in Pascal, and closed immediately 😂😂😂. 

Well today we're gonna learn some Pascal together so we can enjoy this ancient masterpiece.

* If you like look over the small Pascal tutorials as a team.
* Put 20 mins on the clock
* cd into exercises directory
* complete `hello_world.pas`
* ... to run: ``make run-pascal FILE=exercises/hello_world.pas``
* complete `linked_list.pas` (not necessary but it may help if you've done week 2 challenge first)
