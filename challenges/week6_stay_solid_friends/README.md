# 🏆 Week [6] - Stay SOLID Friends .. or is it: Stay SOLID, Friends. ?

## 📝 Challenge Overview
Become **software architects** by fixing broken code samples across multiple languages using the **SOLID principles**!

You'll be given messy, badly-designed examples in Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, and C++. After last weeks head-to-head compition, we're gonna work together and **refactor them as a group** to follow the famous SOLID design guidelines. You'll learn how to spot design flaws quickly and practice clean, maintainable coding techniques that scale.

---

## 🏁 Challenge Format:
**Collaborative** 🤝💻 Work as a team to clean up the legacy of that ex-employee whose code somehow became the scapegoat for all our mess. Take as long as you need though the aim was could complete in 5-10 mins per file. 

---

### 📋 Requirements & Specifications:

- 🛠 Refactor each provided bad code sample.
- 🧹 Each refactor should **focus on one or more SOLID principles**.
- ✍️ Document what SOLID principle(s) were violated and how your changes fix it.
- 🚀 Languages covered:
  - Python
  - Go
  - Ruby
  - PHP
  - C++

---

## 🎯 Bonus Ideas
- 🌟 Try adding new functionality without changing existing classes (test OCP understanding).
- 📜 Create interfaces/abstract classes where appropriate.
- 🧠 Discuss as a team which violations were the hardest to spot!

---

### 🔧 Example Problem Set

Imagine:

- 🐍 Python class doing file saving *and* business logic together.
- 🦅 Go interface that makes non-flying birds crash the app.
- 💎 Ruby service tightly coupled to a specific database implementation.
- 🐘 PHP printer class that needs a giant `if` statement for every format.
- ⚙️ C++ button class saving directly to a database.

Each one is screaming for a SOLID rescue!
