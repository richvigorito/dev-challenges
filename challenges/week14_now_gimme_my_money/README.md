## ðŸ’² Strategy Pattern: Wheres my money?

This week's challenge builds off the ideas in **last weekâ€™s Pascal deep dive**, where we cracked open *Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs*. Chapter 1 walked us through the fundamentals: integers, characters, floating point numbers, arrays, and "records" (think: early objects/structs); including floating point representation, the pitfalls of precision and cool algorithms like [negative powers of two](https://github.com/richvigorito/the-best-programming-book-ever-written/tree/main/src/chapters/1_fundamental_data_structures/negative_power_of_2).

Now weâ€™re zooming in on **floating point math**, particularly when summing money â€” because nothing sparks a heated Slack thread like rounding errors in a banking system.

### ðŸŽ¯ The Scenario:
Youâ€™ve inherited an invoicing system with a pluggable `SumModule` component. The team is divided:

- Should we sum values **as-is with floats**?
- Should we **convert to cents** and avoid FP altogether?
- Would fancy algorithms like [Kahan summation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/kahan-summation-algorithm/), [improved Neumaier version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm#Further_enhancements) or a language specific package/datatype that uses [arbitray precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) like ([go big](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big), [php bcmath](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php), [python decimal module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html), etc) to reduce errors 'enough'?

Your task: implement as many versions and compare!

## ðŸ§ª [Strategy Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) in Action

In addition to playing with floating point precision, this challenge is a great way to practice the **Strategy Pattern**:

> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable without modifying the client code.

Each summation style is a *strategy*. Your invoicing system shouldn't care which one it uses â€” just that it implements the right interface.

```python
class SumModule:
    def compute(self, amounts: List[float]) -> float:
        pass
```

Swap in different modules like:

```python
total = KahanSum().compute(amounts)
```

Why does this matter? Because clean, modular design keeps you from rewriting your logic every time your team changes its mind about how to count money (which, letâ€™s be honest, is inevitable).

\## ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Ideas
Try writing a test case that highlights the differences between the three methods. The naive sum might surprise you.
