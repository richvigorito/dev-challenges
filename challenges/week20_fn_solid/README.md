# 💪 Week [20] - Fn(SOLID): A Solid Function ... or does it mean "F*ckn Solid?"


## 📝 Challenge Overview
This is the second installment in this challenge series dedicated to **SOLID principles** cause lets face it, whether it be guys before or AI, you're still gonna be cleaning up other "people's" poorly designed code. In the [env directory](./env) there is a container you'll drop into go with all the various runtimes you'll need to run after you fix these files.

---

## 🏁 Challenge Format:
**Collaborative** 🤝💻 Work as a team to clean up the legacy of that ex-employee whose code somehow became the scapegoat for all our mess. Take as long as you need though the aim was could complete in 5-10 mins per file. 


## Usage
```bash
docker build -t solid_challenge .
docker run -it --name solid-dev solid_challenge

# once inside the container there are 3 directories
# readonly for reference of files
# solidify directory, for you to make your edits
# and solutions dir which is what i ended up coming up with

# To run your files
make run-python
make run-go
make run-java
make run-csharp
make run-ts
```
