# 🛡️ Week [12] - Access Granted

## 📝 Challenge Overview  
Following last week’s XOR/caesar cipher exploits, we’re pivoting from **trivial encryption** to **real-world security instincts**.

This week isn’t about writing crypto — it’s about spotting what goes wrong when other people try.

We added **three new security quizzes** to the [FlipCup game](https://flipcup.fly.dev) — covering auth schemes, exploit vectors, and general security hygiene. Then you’ll head to a few real-world playgrounds where you can try poking holes in intentionally vulnerable systems.

🔓 You’ve secured. Now it’s time to break in.
