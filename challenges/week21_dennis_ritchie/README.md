# Week 21: Its Dennis Ritchie's Birthday üñ•Ô∏è

Today we celebrate **Dennis Ritchie**, the creator of **C**, the language that literally made modern computing possible. Without C, we might still trying to build **web apps in Fortran‚Ä¶ on mainframes‚Ä¶ with punch cards**!

This week‚Äôs challenge is a **nod to classic C programming**. You don‚Äôt need prior C experience ‚Äî the problems are simple, fun, and historically significant.

## Challenge: Historical C Exercises

You can attempt **all three** or just pick a subset. These exercises are inspired by classic C snippets that shaped the programming world. We‚Äôll use **pseudo code** to guide you. You'll want to download the [The C Programming Language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auspbro/ebook-c/master/The.C.Programming.Language.2Nd.Ed%20Prentice.Hall.Brian.W.Kernighan.and.Dennis.M.Ritchie..pdf) pdf

1Ô∏è‚É£ [The worlds most famous program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program):

```c
// Pseudo code:
// Print the text "Hello, World!" to the screen
// Reference: K&R C 2nd Edition, Chapter 1, Exercise 1
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Echo Input Until EOF

File: echo.c
```c
// Pseudo code:
// Loop: read a character from input
// While the character is not end-of-file
//     Print the character back to the screen
// Reference: K&R C 2nd Edition, Chapter 1, Exercise 2
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Pointer String Iteration

File: pointer_string.c
```c
// Pseudo code:
// Create a string variable, e.g. "hello, world"
// Set a pointer to the start of the string
// Loop: while pointer is not at the end of the string
//     Print the character pointed to
//     Move pointer to the next character
// Reference: K&R C 2nd Edition, Chapter 2, Exercise 2-1
```


### Fun Facts About C & Dennis Ritchie

* Dennis Ritchie co-created Unix with Ken Thompson. Many modern OSes (including Linux and macOS) trace their roots to that work.
* C introduced low-level memory control while remaining portable ‚Äî a revolutionary concept in the 1970s.
* Ritchie once joked that he wished he had invented a language that ‚Äúwould disappear and leave only great programs behind.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúC is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success.‚Äù ‚Äì Dennis Ritchie
* Many modern languages, including Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, owe their foundations to C.
  * Check out my [PHP extension](https://github.com/richvigorito/php-ext-uuid) written in C for native UUID support (including Snowflake)

#### üìº Better Than A Podcast
Ever wondered what it would be like to read a programming book like a novel? Here‚Äôs a 9-hour audiobook of [The C Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-_s8f5K30I).  And if you want to follow along can use [https://www.cc4e.com/](https://www.cc4e.com/) ...  you'll have to crack the code though. Hint: Hitchhikers
