# Dev Challenge 001 - 
# 🏆 Week [4] - Arithmetic From Scratch

## 📝 Challenge Overview

Implement a basic arithmetic library using **only recursion and very limited operators** — no `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, or built-in math functions allowed!

This is a great warm-up for teams to stretch their problem-solving muscles and think about how computation really works under the hood.

## 🏁 Challenge Format: 
**Head-to-Head** 🏁🔥 and given 30 mins how far can each person get and then share your results. Spice it up and each person pick a different langauge and implement, then show the implementation discussing the differences.  


### 📋 Requirements & Specifications
Using only the following:

- Unary minus (`-x`)
- Auto-increment (`++`)
- Auto-decrement (`--`)

Re-implement core arithmetic operations:

- `add(a, b)` – Addition
- `sub(a, b)` – Subtraction
- `mult(a, b)` – Multiplication
- `div(a, b)` – Integer Division (truncate toward zero)
- `modulo(a, b)` – Modulus (hint: this will help with division)
- `exponent(a, b)` – Exponentiation (`a` to the power of `b`)

---

## 🎯 Bonus

As a stretch goal, **eliminate all use of**:

- Unary minus
- `++` (increment)
- `--` (decrement)

...and instead implement **everything using recursion and bitwise operations only**, such as:

- `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`

Recreate `incr(n)` and `decr(n)` using pure bitwise logic, and use those to rebuild the other operations.
