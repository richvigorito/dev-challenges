# 🧠 Week [8] – Flipcup: Trivia Meets Team Spirit

## 📝 Challenge Overview  
This week’s challenge dials it way down on brain-bending syntax... and turns the **team pressure way up**.  

You’ll be playing a game inspired by flip cup, but instead of chugging drinks, you’re racing to answer trivia questions. It’s fast-paced, loud, chaotic, and **way more fun with a team**.  

You’ll need to think quickly, type quickly (no-typos), and—most importantly—**flip the damn cup**.

## 🕹️ How Flip-Quiz Works

- Two teams compete to be the first to finish all their questions.
- Each player must answer a question **on their turn**.
- Get it right? Your turn ends.
- Get it wrong? You're stuck until you try again.

It’s not just about being smart—it’s about being fast *and* keeping your team moving.
