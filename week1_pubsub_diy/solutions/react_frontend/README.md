# ⚛️ Pub/Sub UI – React Frontend

This is an optional React UI to go along with the pub/sub backend from Dev Challenge 003.

You can:

- Subscribe to a topic over WebSockets
- Publish messages to a topic using HTTP

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Visit the app
```bash 
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔧 How It Works

Uses WebSocket to connect to: ``ws://localhost:8000/subscribe/<topic>``

Uses HTTP POST to publish to: ``http://localhost:8000/publish/raw/<topic>``

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: My FE proficency/skills aren't the best as such out of expediency, this ui was mostly generated by ChatGPT.
