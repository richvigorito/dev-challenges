# 🏆 Week [9] - We Need To Go Deeper (Programming Language Edition)

## 📝 Challenge Overview  
Sharpen your polyglot powers with a high-speed cross-language execution gauntlet: **write a program that runs a program written in another language** — and do it in **as many ways as you know how** within 20 minutes!


## 🏁 Challenge Format:  
**Head-to-Head Speed Round** ⚡🌐  
Put **20 minutes** on the clock. Write as many working programs as you can where a **program in one language executes another program in a different language**. Most importantly, after 20 mins, share your work. 

---

### 📋 Requirements & Specs

- 🚀 Each solution must **launch and execute** code in another language.
- ✅ It must work — no pseudocode. Show it runs and prints something.
- 💬 Print enough to show both the outer and inner program executed.
- 🌍 Use any languages, but focus on the interop style rather than the language name.
- ✍️ For each, add a quick comment explaining the **mechanism used**.
- 💬 Share/discuss your work w/ the team and if/when you'd ever want to incorporate interoperable programs in your projects.

## 🎯 Bonus Ideas

- 🧵 Chain multiple hops(code within code... [dream within a dream](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inception) get it?): e.g., Go → Python → C -> Assembly
- 🧪 Try lesser-known interop (like embedding Lua, or using JNI)
- 🔁 Try the same language combo with multiple strategies
- 🕵️‍♀️ Log or capture the output of the inner program and use it in the outer
