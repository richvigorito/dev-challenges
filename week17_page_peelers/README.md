# 📚Week [17] - Page Peelers

⏱ **30 minutes on the clock — best solution wins.**

## **Background**
Your task is to scrape the public test site [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com) — a sandbox site made specifically for practicing web scraping — and put your skills to the test.

---

## **Your Mission**
Write a script that:

1. **Scrapes 10 pages deep** from `https://books.toscrape.com` (page count is a script input).
2. **Extracts all image URLs** from each page.
3. **Downloads all images** into a `downloads/` folder.

## **Rules**
- Any programming language is allowed.
- Respect polite scraping (don’t hammer the site with requests).
- The clock stops at 30 minutes (or decide a different time limit).
- Show your work, and discuss whose solution you liked best.

## **Solution**
The inspiration for this challenge was actually a recent interview I did and despite correctly completing the task with 10 minutes to spared in the interview I was still rejected. My redacted interview solution, interview retrospectvie, as well an improved version of my interview script are located in the [solution directory](./solution).
