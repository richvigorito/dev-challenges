# Dev Challenges

Welcome to **Dev Challenges**, a collection of weekly coding challenges designed for small teams or groups to solve in a fun, quick, and collaborative setting. Each challenge is designed to be completed in about an hour to an hour and a half, making it a perfect way to wind down after work or to spark some friendly competition.

The challenges will be released weekly and come in different formats: head-to-head races, question/answer games, and collaborative problem-solving challenges. These are not long, drawn-out projects — they're quick, dirty, and hopefully enjoyable while still being a little thought-provoking.

## 💡 How it Works

Every **Thursday morning**, a new challenge will be released for teams to tackle together. You can get together as a team after work on Thursday or Friday for a fun and productive session before the weekend kicks off.

### Challenge Formats:
- **Head-to-Head:** 🏁🔥 A race against the clock to see who can finish the challenge first or get the most done in a given time.
- **Question/Answer:** ❓💡 A trivia-style challenge with questions that need to be answered within a time limit.
- **Collaborative:** 🤝💻 Team-based challenges where you split the work or brainstorm together to solve a problem or build something small.

### Who are these challenges for?
These challenges are ideal for:
- **Small teams or groups** (Dev teams, study groups, etc.)
- **After-work sessions** or **team-building exercises**
- **Getting to know your team better** in a low-pressure, fun environment

### What's the goal?
The goal is simple:
- **Have fun** solving problems together
- **Improve your skills** in a variety of topics (algorithms, data structures, system design, etc.)
- **Build stronger teams** with a little friendly competition and collaborative problem-solving

These challenges are designed to be approachable yet thought-provoking. Sometimes they'll be informative, sometimes they'll just get you thinking differently. But mostly, they’re a great way to bring a team together, all while sharpening your coding skills.
