# Dev Challenges

Welcome to **Dev Challenges**, a collection of weekly coding challenges designed for small teams or groups to solve in a fun, quick, and collaborative setting. Each challenge is designed to be completed in about anywhere between 15 mins to an hour max, making it a perfect way to wind down after work or to spark some friendly competition. 

The challenges will be released weekly and come in different formats: head-to-head races, question/answer games, and collaborative problem-solving challenges. These are not long, drawn-out projects ‚Äî they're quick, dirty, and hopefully enjoyable while still being a little thought-provoking. My hope people subscribe and can be a fun team building exercise (and allows me to do little mini programs in languages I dont get to program everyday).

## üí° How it Works
Every **Thursday**, a new challenge will be released for teams to tackle together. You can get together as a team after work on Thursday or Friday for a fun and productive session before the weekend kicks off.

### Challenge Formats:
- **Head-to-Head:** üèÅüî• A race against the clock to see who can finish the challenge first or get the most done in a given time.
- **Question/Answer:** ‚ùìüí° A trivia-style challenge with questions that need to be answered within a time limit.
- **Collaborative:** ü§ùüíª Team-based challenges where you split the work or brainstorm together to solve a problem or build something small.

### Who are these challenges for?
These challenges are ideal for:
- **Small teams or groups** (Dev teams, study groups, etc.)
- **After-work sessions** or **team-building exercises**
- **Getting to know your team better** in a low-pressure, fun environment

### What's the goal?
The goal is simple:
- **Have fun** solving problems together
- **Improve your skills** in a variety of topics (algorithms, data structures, system design, etc.)
- **Most Importantly, build stronger teams** with a little friendly competition and collaborative problem-solving

These challenges are designed to be approachable yet thought-provoking. Sometimes they'll be informative, sometimes they'll just get you thinking differently. But mostly, they‚Äôre a great way to bring a team together, all while sharpening your coding skills.

## üõ† Solutions
For each challenge, I will provide at least **one solution** (sometimes multiple solutions) for you to review and learn from. Feel free to experiment with your own approaches!
‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Most the challenges I personally do as well. 1) I enjoy them and 2) find these small games good practice for languages im improving on. Some solutions, which will be limited to frontend solution code, may have been generated with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT; if they are they will be noted.  Always feel free to improve or experiment with your own code!


## üì¢ Want to Contribute?
Feel free to submit challenge ideas or create a pull request with your own working solution! Time permitting, I‚Äôll merge it and give you credit in the README. If you find a bug in one of my solutions, don't hesitate to PR a fix ‚Äî I‚Äôll review and merge it.
